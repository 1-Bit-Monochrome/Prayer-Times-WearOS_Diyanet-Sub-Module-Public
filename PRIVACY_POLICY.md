# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** December 30, 2025

This privacy policy applies to the app **"Prayer Times"** (including its Wear OS component) created by **1-Bit Monochrome**.

We respect your privacy. This app is designed to collect as little data as possible. Below we explain what information is processed.

### 1. Location Data
To calculate accurate prayer times and Qibla direction, the app relies on location information.

* **Manual Selection:** By default, you can manually select your city or location from a list. In this case, no GPS or precise location data is accessed or required.
* **GPS/Network Location (Optional):** If the app offers an "Automatic Location" feature and you choose to use it, the app will request permission to access your device's location. This data is processed **exclusively on your device** to calculate the times. It is **not** transmitted to external servers, stored, or shared with third parties.

### 2. Personal Information
We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, phone number, or email address).

### 3. Children’s Privacy
Our app is family-friendly. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

### 4. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.

### 5. Contact Us
