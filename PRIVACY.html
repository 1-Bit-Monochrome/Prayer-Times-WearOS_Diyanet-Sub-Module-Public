    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 30, 2025</p>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the app <strong>"Prayer Times"</strong> (including its Wear OS component) created by <strong>1-Bit Monochrome</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>We respect your privacy. This app is designed to collect as little data as possible. Below we explain what information is processed.</p>

    <h3>1. Location Data</h3>
    <p>To calculate accurate prayer times and Qibla direction, the app relies on location information.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Manual Selection:</strong> By default, you can manually select your city or location from a list. In this case, no GPS or precise location data is accessed or required.</li>
        <li><strong>GPS/Network Location (Optional):</strong> If the app offers an "Automatic Location" feature and you choose to use it, the app will request permission to access your device's location. This data is processed <strong>exclusively on your device</strong> to calculate the times. It is <strong>not</strong> transmitted to external servers, stored, or shared with third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, phone number, or email address).</p>

    <h3>3. Children’s Privacy</h3>
    <p>Our app is family-friendly. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>

    <h3>4. Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>
